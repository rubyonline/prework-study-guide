# <Ruby-Study-Guide>

## Description

This project was made as an introduction to web development. It provides some key notes that helped me make the website! This project should help students going through the prework remember and catch up on web development basics. 

I learned a fair bit making this website, like the basics of html, css, javascript, and git! The website should be useful to anyone needing to catch up or get a refresher on those topics.

## Usage
